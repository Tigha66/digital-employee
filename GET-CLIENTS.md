**Start with 1 industry. Master it. Then expand.**

## Phase 3: Convert (Week 2-4)

### Step 7: The Sales Call (15 min)

**Call Script:**

2. **Discovery (5 min)**
Ask:
- "How many leads come in per week?"
- "What happens to them?"
- "What's your average client worth?"
- "How do you handle scheduling?"

3. **Demo (5 min)**
Show them the landing page. Point to:
- Email management capability
- Lead response speed
- Calendar integration
- Pricing

4. **Close (3 min)**
> "Here's what I can do: Deploy an AI employee that handles [their main pain point]. One-time setup $997, then $297/month. Want to move forward?"

### Step 8: Handle Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Too expensive" | "What would it be worth to save 40 hours/month? That's like $8/hour vs your $200/hour value" |
| "Need to think" | "What specifically? Let's address it now" |
| "I have staff" | "This assists them - makes your team 10x more productive" |
