## Template 1: The Short Pitch

**Subject:** Save 20 hours/week

```
Hi [First Name],

I help insurance agents save 20+ hours every week with AI employees.

Instead of hiring a $4,000/month assistant, you get an AI that:
- Answers leads in 2 minutes (not 4 hours)
- Schedules consultations automatically
- Follows up with every single prospect

One agent closed $15,000 MORE per month after using it.

Quick question: What's your biggest time-waster right now?

## Template 2: The Data Pitch

**Subject:** [Agency Name] + 47 missed leads

```
Hi [First Name],

Here's what I found:

Average insurance agent gets 60 leads/month.
At 40% follow-up rate = 36 leads ignored/month.
At $800 average policy = $28,800 lost revenue/month.

What if every single lead got a response within 2 minutes?

That's what our AI does. $997 setup, $297/month.

Want to see how it works?

## Template 3: The Referral Pitch

**Subject:** [Mutual Friend] thought you'd want to know

```
Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Friend or "A colleague of yours"] told me you're doing big volume in [city].

They said your biggest challenge is keeping up with leads.

I help insurance agents like yourself deploy AI employees that handle:
- Lead response (2 min avg)
- Appointment scheduling  
- Follow-ups

[Mutual Friend] said I should reach out.

Worth a 5-minute chat?

## Template 4: The Case Study Pitch

**Subject:** How [Similar Agent] added $21k/month

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How many leads do you get per month?

Here's what happened for Sarah, an insurance agent in [city]:

BEFORE:
- 45% lead response rate
- 4 hour response time
- $24,000/month revenue

AFTER (with AI employee):
- 98% lead response rate  
- 2 minute response time
- $45,000/month revenue (+$21k!)

She now spends 1.5 hours/week on admin instead of 40 hours.

Worth a call to see how it works?

## Template 5: The Low-Risk Pitch

**Subject:** 30-day test (on us)

```
Hi [First Name],

What if you could test an AI employee for 30 days - risk-free?

If it doesn't save you 20+ hours/month, you pay nothing.

That's our guarantee.

Here's what it does:
- Responds to every lead in 2 minutes
- Schedules consultations on your calendar
- Follows up automatically until they convert

Setup takes 5 days. Then it runs itself.

Curious?

Best,

**Subject:** One more thing

```
Hi [First Name],
