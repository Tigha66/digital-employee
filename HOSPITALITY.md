## 📧 Cold Email Template for Hotels

**Subject:** Save 7 hours/day at [Hotel Name]

```
Hi [Name],

I help hotels save 7+ hours every day with AI employees.

Instead of hiring a front desk manager ($4,000+/month), 
you get an AI that:

- Responds to booking inquiries in 2 minutes
- Handles guest requests automatically
- Responds to reviews within hours
- Coordinates with housekeeping

One boutique hotel reduced front desk time from 8 hours 
to 1 hour per day.

Worth a 10-minute chat?

Best,

## Industries in Hospitality to Target

| Industry | Best For | Pain Point |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Boutique Hotels** | 10-30 rooms | Personal service at scale |
| **Hotels** | 30-100 rooms | 24/7 operation |
| **Vacation Rentals** | Multiple properties | Multiple guest communication |
| **Bed & Breakfasts** | Small properties | Owner burnout |
| **Hostels** | Budget travelers | High volume, low margin |

## Best Target: Boutique Hotels

**Why:**
- 10-30 rooms
- Owner often works front desk
- High touch = high value
- Decision maker = owner (not corporate)
