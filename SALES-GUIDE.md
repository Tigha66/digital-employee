## 🎯 How to Sell to SMBs

### 1. Find Your Target Clients

**Best SMBs to target:**
- Real estate agents/brokers
- Insurance agencies  
- Law firms
- Medical practices
- Financial advisors
- Marketing agencies
- E-commerce stores
- Fitness studios
- Restaurants
- Home service companies

**Their pain points:**
- "I don't have time to follow up with leads"
- "My email is out of control"
- "I'm missing appointments"
- "Staff is too expensive"
- "I do everything myself"

---

### 2. The Sales Pitch

**Cold Call / Email Template:**

> "Hi [Name], I help [industry] businesses like yours save 40+ hours per week using AI employees. 
> 
> Instead of hiring a $4,000/month assistant, we deploy a custom AI that handles your email, schedules appointments, and follows up with leads - for $297/month.
> 
> Want to see a 5-minute demo? This Thursday at 10am works?"

---

### 3. The Consultation Call (15 min)

**Script:**

1. **Opening (2 min)**
> "Thanks for your time. Before we start, what's the #1 thing taking your time right now?"

2. **Discovery (5 min)**
Ask:
- "How many leads come in per week?"
- "What happens to them now?"
- "How much time do you spend on email?"
- "What's your average client value?"

3. **Demo (5 min)**
Show them the landing page:
- point to specific capabilities matching their needs

4. **Close (3 min)**
> "Here's what I can do for you: Deploy an AI employee that [specific task]. One-time setup $997, then $297/month. Want to move forward?"

---

### 4. Handling Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "What would it be worth to save 40 hours/month? That's like hiring someone for $8/hour" |
| "I need to think about it" | "What specifically do you want to think about? Let's address it now" |
| "My team handles this" | "Great! The AI assists them - makes them 10x more productive" |
| "We tried automation before" | "This is different - it's AI that learns YOUR processes, not rigid rules" |

## 📞 Scripts for Common Situations

### When Client Says "Send Me Info"

> "Perfect! I'll send over a one-pager. But honestly, the best way to see if this works is a 5-minute call. Can I schedule that for you Thursday or Friday?"

### When Client Wants to "Try It Free"

> "I don't offer free trials because I customize everything for your business. But I do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it's not saving you 20+ hours, I'll refund the difference."

### When They Ask "How Is This Different From Zapier?"

> "Zapier is rules-based - if X then Y. This is AI that makes decisions. It reads emails, understands context, and responds appropriately. It's like having a smart assistant, not a robot."
