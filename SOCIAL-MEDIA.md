### Post 1: The Problem
```
🐕 Every business owner knows this feeling...

You close a deal, then immediately:
📧 Answer emails
📅 Schedule calls
🔄 Follow up with leads
📝 Update CRM

You became an entrepreneur to SELL - not to do admin.

What if an AI did all that for you?

👇
```

### Post 2: The Solution
```
🚀 Just deployed my 50th AI Employee

What it does:
✅ Answers leads in 2 minutes (not 4 hours)
✅ Schedules meetings on your calendar
✅ Follows up automatically
✅ Responds to reviews

Costs $297/month
(starts at $997 setup)

That's cheaper than a VA - and it works 24/7

Who's interested? 👇

### Post 3: The Result
```
💰 Before AI: $24k/month revenue
💰 After AI: $45k/month revenue

Same insurance agent.
Same work hours.
Different system.

She saved 35 hours/week by hiring an AI employee.

The math:
- 40h saved × $100/h value = $4,000/week
- AI cost: $297/month

That's a 13x ROI 🚀

Want the same?
