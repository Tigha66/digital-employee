Hi [First Name],

I help [industry] professionals save 20+ hours every week.

One agent closed $15,000 MORE per month after using it.

Quick question: What's your biggest time-waster right now?

## Scripts for Different Industries

### For Insurance Agents:
```
Subject: [Agency Name] + 47 missed leads

Hi [Name],

Here's the math:

60 leads/month × 40% miss = 24 lost leads
At $800/policy = $19,200 lost/month

What if every lead got a response in 2 minutes?

That's what our AI does.

```

### For Real Estate:
```
Subject: Save 30 hours/week as a busy agent

Hi [Name],

You're showing houses, negotiating deals, and closing.

You shouldn't be:
- Answering "is this available?" emails
- Scheduling showings
- Following up with buyers

Our AI handles all of that - for $297/month.

Want to see how it works?
```

### For Hotels:
```
Subject: Save 7 hours/day at [Hotel Name]

Hi [Name],

Front desk work is 24/7. You can't staff it all the time.

Our AI:
- Answers booking inquiries in 2 minutes
- Handles guest requests
- Responds to reviews

One hotel went from 8 hours/day to 1 hour.

Worth a chat?
